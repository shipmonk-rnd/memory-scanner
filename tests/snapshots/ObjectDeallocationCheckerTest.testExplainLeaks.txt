Expected all tracked objects to be deallocated, but total of 1 object is still in memory.

  The following 1 object could not be deallocated, because it is referenced from 'static property ShipMonkTests\MemoryScanner\ObjectDeallocationCheckerTest::$leakTest':
    Object 'Foo' is referenced thought the following path:
      -> static property ShipMonkTests\MemoryScanner\ObjectDeallocationCheckerTest::$leakTest
      -> foo
       = {Foo}
